HTML and CSS are fundamental languages for front-end development. HTML provides the structure and semantic markup for web content, while CSS controls the presentation and styling. They are essential for creating visually appealing, responsive, and accessible web pages, enabling developers to craft engaging user experiences and bring designs to life on the web. Without HTML and CSS, front-end development would be incomplete, as they form the backbone of every website and lay the foundation for other technologies and frameworks to build upon.

In this assignment, you will transform the given high fidelity wireframe into a responsive website using only HTML and CSS. Feel free to unleash your creativity by choosing colors and images that complement the design. Remember to maintain the font styles as per the provided design.
